ProblemD. A simpler description:

Lets call the top left forest F0. We can label lands as Li and Forests as Fi with distint i's.
We need to find the minimum cost to build bridges.cost of a bridge on a node is number of bridges from its nearest for

1. A simple bfs with two tags node inserted and visiyed.
2. A visited node is one which has been extarcted from que and fully exploded.
3. An inserted node is one which is just put into Queue but not exploded.
4.M1.in the bfs we sort by forest to island. M2In islands we sort by least weight first.
5.After a forest (s) has entered the bfs que, the remaing nodes in q must be checked if they are near to forest or not. This is made possible
by M1. Also id some node is visitable by low weight island, the cost would be less . So every node in que and subsequent should be tackled
 from least node angle first provided by M2.
6. What about already visited nodes? A forest can only follow a already visited node by M1 so that means in topological ordering there is
no way that forest could have come before any of visited nodes. What about the low weight nodes. M2 would have ensured that toplogical ordering
must have made visited nodes a strict predecessor of cureent in-q islands. thus it follows.



-------------
Can we do a bfs on nodes with rep (a1,a2,a3) with a  ordering defined by ranges on a1 a2 a3. that are symmetric and transitive.Is transitive
even required.Transitive must be required otherwise que will be undefined!

Q. Can ordered nodes have emegent values. i.e a value based on sequence of its predecoors. yes We can define an aritrary function on immediate
last k predecessors. This can define as much complexity as you want with complexity directly proportional to past k predecessors.
