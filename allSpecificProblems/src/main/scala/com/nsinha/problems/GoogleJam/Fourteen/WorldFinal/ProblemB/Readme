1. Power of 2 numbers
2.New SOrting for (1,2,..2^N) in any permutation
3.Range of nos to be swapped.
3a. If range contains 2^k and start pos is multiple of 2^k
     i,e the range must be m*2^k to (m+1)*2^k
3b. Two ranges must be same size to be swapped.

4.At most one swap of each size for k in[0,N)

----------

A1. Let's have a a longer followed by a shorter move. We prove there exists a shorter followed by a larger move of exact respective sizes.

If the moves are not intersecting they commute.

Let's assume they inetrsect. In tjsi case the shorter followed by larger can have one of these cases. Note that Larger is atleast twice greater than
smaller one:

case 1. The  smaller one  may swap ranges that fall in two parts which later is part of swap by larger. We can first do
the larger swap and do the same smaller range swap.

case 2. The smaller swaps ranges in a part that fully gets relocated by larger swap. In this case we first do large swap followed by smaller swap
with intervals moved by range of larger swap. So we get the same effect.






A2. In A1 swap will always take a sorted subrange to another sorted range if we follow A1. Less this , the scheme A1 can never work.
