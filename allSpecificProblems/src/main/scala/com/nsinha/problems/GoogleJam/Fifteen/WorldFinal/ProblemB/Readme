Axioms:
   1 Only families with 1, 2 or 3 members are allowed in the camp. Also, each tent can contain members of only one family,
    and families cannot be split across multiple tents.
   2 So she wants exactly 3 members in each row and column.
   3 There shouldn't be more than 2 tents in any row or column.

Givens N and X (min of 3 member)

A1. What's the range of X not more than N.
Because no row can have  more than 3 members so we have just 1 3 mem family at a given row. So we cant exceed N.
So we have 3members family from X to N inclusive


A2. Consider a partial problem i.e 3mem = a where a is in [X,N]

Choose any <a> rows . A row can have 0 or 1 three family so choosing a rows is a essential condition to assign a families
to different rows
row 1  ✓
2
3 ✓
4
.
. ✓
n


this done we could not have any more families in those rows. We also need a cols from n cols  so we can each have differnt
(r,c ) pairs for these a families. we cant have
ri =rj as that will mean that a row has more than one 3 mem family
ci=cj will also mean for column
Our choices for rows and columns will all be correct wrt 2.

Now we have a pairs of (ri,ci) we have n-ri rows and n-ci columns pairs leading to n-ri*n-ci cells that can be filled .

A3. Assuming finish of A2. we have options:
 B1.  Dont fill further. what this will violate.n-a rows wont have any member. So we cant do that.

 B2. for n-a rows we can have (1,1,1) or (1,2)  fills.

 B3. Lets only discuss 1,1,1 options
    in a unfilled row of n-a rows choose 3 cols in set of n-a cols from A2.
    lets call them (c11,c12,c13)
    But this will need more than 3 tents in a row. So 1,1,1 is rejected

 B4. Lets discuss 1,2.
     in a unfilled row of n-a rows choose 2 cols in set of n-a cols from A2.
     lets call them, This takes care of axiom 3 and axiom 2 for the row,

     We should do this for each row .

     C1.We genearted  2(n-a) cols on a value of 1 or 2 . These columns must be coming from the n-a cols set from A2.i.e
     each col was selected 2 times.
     C2. Also exactly one of this value for a col is 1 and remaiming one 2.

 B5. So for row 1 from SetA2Row, we got c11 with value 1 and c12 with value2 from  SetB2Col,
     This fixes ci1 and cj2 at 2 and 1 respectively.

     i and j can determine the other row and col.
     SetA2Row
     we can choose i randomly and j randomly from


 B6. From B5 we choose i randomly. Lets reason about this i.
 so i th row already contains a fam of 2. The only one option that remains  is pickng one more col on ith row
 with value of 1. Can we pick any col.it cant be col c11. the probable set is SetB2Col - c11,

 opposite stands for row j.


 --------------------------------------

 G1.Looks like we keep solving board for colms by their numbers rather than exact identification.
 e.g n-a rows and n-a columns to accomodate the axiom 2 and 3. This is uniform on sizes

 G2. Once we choose a 1 ,2 col for row 1. The next problem can be abstracted as
    (n-a-1 row, n-a cols, 1 filled cols, 2 filled cols, 3 filled cols.)

    To decide on G2 we can pick next row from set and pick two cols from col set with considering the restraint for 1,2,3 filled
    cols. This we can do by generating all the required cols on by one and doun a depth first solution. The Dp will assume that
    later higher level problems make huge uses of similar combinations.
