1. Let events be called e1...e100=E
2. events are sorted by time.
3 two events can have same time
4. A worthy solution would be something like e1 e4 e9 e14 e19 e34 e61 e98 e99. i.e a pick from set of E.

5 SHould we ever visit a earlier time from later time? yeah is e5 visits e2 where e5 happens later than e2 then that means e2 was surviving.
It means we should have two events per event a kill event should be added.
So now E = {e1a,e2a,e1d,e2d,...e89a,e90a,e87d,...}

6. Then e2a can still visit e1d even though e1a precedes e2a.

7.So worthy solution should looklike e1a,e3a,e2d, e5a,e4d, ...

8.So at any point we have to target one of the accessible states from current pos.

9.Lets say we are at state
