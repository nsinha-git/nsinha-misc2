Non-uniform binary search:
1. Let a0 ,... an-1 be the pos in array and we need to find a insertion point based on some input x and comparison. The cost
of comparsion  is non-uniform with pos.
2. A general idea is to collect all the pos with equal wt together.
 Let k such  levelcontours can exist. Note k can be as large as n

 for lowest level let l1 l2 l3 l4 be the indices. Then in general we have lx ly as potential point to work with.
  for next level take this lx ly from last step and map it to nearest right of lx and left of ly.
  How to find nearest right of lx in level2.
  We need to support leastgreaterinLevel(pos) operation in level structure.




A1. Supporting leastGreater(pos). If we arrange the pos in style of range trees, we can support this ops. As no more features will be required
an array based Range tree with bsearch should suffice
