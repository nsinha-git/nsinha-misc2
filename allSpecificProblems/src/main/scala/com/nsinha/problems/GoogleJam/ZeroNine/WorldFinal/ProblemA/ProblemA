The problem has T tournaments t1, t2 ... tT.
A1.T
A2. N days
Each tornament has rounds which are sepatated by period in units of days
So ti = (ri1,ri2, riik) where ik < R
A2.R
between ria and ria+1 there is a period spanning days we can call them di0 (0,1) di2(1,2) .. dik-1(ik-1,ik)
A3. R-1 delays

We need to place the games with equal prob, starting on any of days.
A sample is one placement of tounaments(i,e assigning a start date to every one ,total T^N saples))
A sample value is = ∑(day value of tournaments rounds)^2

We want to find expectation of Exp ( ∑(day Value)^2) across all the possible samples.
A4. Q=Exp ( ∑(day Value)^2) = Exp (∑(day_value_i))
A5. TotalSamples = T^N

2. To Calculate Q we can individually figure for all days their expectation.
A6. Qday_i = Exp(day_value_i^2)
and sum them later to get A4.Q.

3. Qday_i = Exp(day_value_i^2)
A7. day_value_i

4. For a sample day_value_i is number of tournamments whose round are falling in the day.
A8. day_value_i for a sample = V(t1,i) + V(t2,i) + ... + V(tT)
 where V(t1) is 1 if sample has t1 occuring on that day i.
A9. So Q_day_i = Exp(A8^2)
A10. Q_day_i =Exp(∑v(tp,i)^v(tq,i)) = ∑Exp(v(tp,i)^v(tq,i))



5 .what is   Exp(v(tp,i)^v(tq,i))
It's a relationship between a day and tournamment or a day and two tournaments.
Exp(v(tp,i)) = For  a tounament to be happening on day i one of its rounds can happen on that day.
It's one to one mapping betwwen a start date of tournammant and which round gets played in day i. Let's say every
tournament has  a empty round that;s played whenever no round is there to be played at di.
So for any smaple Ω which has a unique tj_start_date there is a :
A11. fn Fn(tj_start_date, date i) = 0 or {rj|all rounds of rj}
Function at A11 is one to one. The inverse function is Gn(rjs, date = i) = tj_start_date
What are all the possible start dates for tj for i: only those which map a round of tj onto i. We can easily count
those rounds that will be in those start date. So we can do this:
A12. F(tj, i) = rounds that will be in i for start dates. A tournamment can have N start dates so we have just
A12 dates that actullay cause a place in day i.
Hence Exp(v(tp,i)) = A12/N (this is possible as A5 is filled equally into N dates. Each sample in A12 bins will contribute to i. As there are A5/N in each bin and there are A12 such bins so (T^N/N)*A12/(T^N)= A12/N
A13. Exp(v(tp,i)^v(tq,i)) = F(tp,i)*F(tq,i) = A12(p) * A12(q)

6.A10 Q_day_i = is easily calculatable once for every tp and tq pair.

7. There exists a Dmax such that if a day> Dmax for every tournamnet the Exp(v(tp,day))= total rounds in tp/n.
and thus Q_day_d= Q_day_dmax for d>=dmax.
