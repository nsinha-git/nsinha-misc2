A1. Try a value n and find the distribution of diffs.

A2. FInd the max distance and sign and max distance in opposite side of sign
Let  they occur at m and n
A3. Let's choose a gradient g in same sign as max D. Then max distance will come down by gm. The opposite sign will go up by ng.

A4. Find the max index  m' and n' that had same and ooposite signs in A2. they will go down by m'g and up by n'g
A4 We have four values now: L = +mg. M = +m'g  , N = -ng, G = -n'g
A5. le's select g =gL0 st L =0. if other distances are lower than max of A2 we could stick with that.
Else g = gL0/2. in this case we will see that each distance will be non -zero. if the worst distance is still better than A2 we choose this else we
halve g again and continue.

A6. If anytime during A5 we reach a value of g st the it's ;less than 10^-7 we let go the process.
