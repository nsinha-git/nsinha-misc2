1. We can look at the problem as rows ops that include row swaps and cols ops which are col swaps.
2. The sequenctila col ops create a col permutation, as do the rows ops.
3. If we imagine row ops just shifting the rows in correct order, then we can imagine the cols ops as the ones actutally
doing the ordering for one of the rows.
4. based on 3 we can ignore the rows ops for now.
5. Talking about the col ops, if we assume the row 1 needing certain ops to align it to checker pattern, then same ops
should align other rows too to either row1 or its exact complememnt. There should be equal of each of these.
6.Once we done 5 we can simply permute rows to pattern.
