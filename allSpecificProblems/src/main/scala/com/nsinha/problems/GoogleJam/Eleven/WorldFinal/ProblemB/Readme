1. We can go through each cell in order of first row last row.
    2 , n-1 row ..
2. At each row cell we should look at all its neighbors and decide the max possible height for the cell. It may be fullly decidable if the neighbor
height is fully decidable and lower.
3. If all neighbors are fully decidable and higher then height is least of all such neighbors and fully decidable.
4. If one neighbor is not fully decided we can only assume max height and call the cell as half -decided.
5. At the end  of 1-2-3-4 we can again, just get all half -decided cells and determine the one(s) withleast height of them. We can fully decide these.
We can also check the neighbors and possibly reduce their indecision and reclassify as half decided with lower indecison or fully decided.
6. We can keep doing 5 as long as any half decided still exists.


A1. The process will finish in finite steps.

Every time in 6 we have a minimum of size atleast one. This makes the cell size go down by atleast 1 in 6. So we will have at worst (w*H)
repeats of 6 each time oing o(w*h) work. so o(w^2*h^2) = o(160k)

A2. o(w*h) work every time to decide drain direction and reduction.

A3.Each reduction would atleast be reduce periphey cells by M. total height can at max be w*h*Max wt.
Every day will atleast reduce M*4*max(w,h). so max days is w*maxwt/M = 10^15*20

A4. A3 *A1  is completely

Dijstra approach

D1. If two cells are differnibg less by M and one cell attaches to Sea and then visits the other cell, then
 the prelude captures all the irregularity of decrements.

 Let h1 , h2 and h1<h2 and h2 -h1 = p <M

 let h2 has prelude (h2,h21,h22) .M k steps and psotlude h2p
 so h2 = Mk+h2p + (h22-h2)

 just looking at end of prelude i,e h22 and counting the length of prelude i.e we check:q
