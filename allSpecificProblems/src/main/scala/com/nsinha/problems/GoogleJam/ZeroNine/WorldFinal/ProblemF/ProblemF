Try 1:
1.Divide 100 in M sgements each of length D=100/M. We have M*M grids.

2. Each grid has a center Cg.

3. There are at most 50 pillars.

4. For each Cg and R and G : create a line from R and Cg. Check if line passes the 50 pillars. If yes , we dont have  R hitting the Cg.
Repeat this fpr G. These cases may result:
1. No body hits: Black
2, Both hits : yellow
3. One of them hits: red or green.

5. The total complexity is M*M*50*2 =M^2*100.

6. Assuming we can do, 2^20 ops M can be M= 2^7 leading to 2^21 ops

P1. We can do more fine blockings on a block if we see it to be near a pillar.



Try 2:
Problem with above approach is number of compuattion steps can be much larger. We have no dependency between
o/p and num points needed. A setup can easily work while the other may not!


o/p driven suggests to treat only relevant events. We can do linear scan and do only whats needed.
