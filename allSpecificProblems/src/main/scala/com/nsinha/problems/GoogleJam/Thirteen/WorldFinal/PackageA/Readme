1. The multitude of rows are cars. The event points for each care are the (starting time ST, intersection S), end time, intersection E)
and (midTime, Intersection). There can be two midtimes depending on interval being even or odd.
2. We need to create starting times at endTime of each car with one off intersection. We need to extend it to left and right till we
collide with some other car or reach end of time.
3.We need to also consider endtimes of a car finishing at one-off car start pos at same car tart time. Similar logic for mid points of car.
4. We claim that any maximal path will always fall in one of these event spaces.


--------------
1. Given a point (n,t) finding the left and right boundaries and thus length:

for each Ci. let ts be start time , m be start intersection and ∇  be time of sojourn.

case 1: ts < t: i.e car started earlier than n,t. then we have a possible left boundary by ci.The intersection time ti is
ti = (t+ ts)/2 - (m-n)/2.
if(0<=ti-ts<= ∇ ) its a valid left boundary. Find the len as (t-  ti+1 ).
case 2 :ts >t : car started after n,t.Find ti as (t+ts)/2 - (n-m)/2.
if(0<=ti-ts<=∇ )its a  right boundary. Find the len  as (ti-1-   t).

Thus we can find a min of left and right boudnary length for any point (n,t). This is complex as o(C)

2. We have C start points and 2*C endpoints. =  3C potential points.
We can find a len of each of these 3C points in o(3c^2).
