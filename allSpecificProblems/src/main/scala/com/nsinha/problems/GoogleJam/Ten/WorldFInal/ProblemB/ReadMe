1. Consider node N with many entry paths.

2. Lets start doing a dfs from arbitrary point if graph

A1. Any point dfs will always visit N. Easy to prove by all connected properties of first three nodes and induction.

3. We can visit the N first time as in P1, or later times P2 P2C

4. N can be in three states: Unvisted, visited and StillVisiting,

5. A P1 N was unvisited and turned to a visit. A P1 prefix exists when visiting N

6. We do a further dfs on N and append N to P1 prefix

7. Let N dfs has  cycle to N w/o a node in P1. Then we call it P2c. When P2c reaches N we have N StillVisiting.

8. Any the length of this cycle is fully determined by later portion of N and does not depend on P1. So we can subtarct P1 from P2C
and that's the length of this cycle. We can record if this is largest and clip the dfs.

9. Let N be visitable again but that includes a point in P1. Then that earlier point will clip the dfs and we can have no such path
formation onto N.

10. Let's consider a P2 visit to N when N was done to visited. Let P2-P1 is nonEmpty and M be a point in that set. If there exists a cycle to
such M through N then M must have been visited by N dfs in stillvisiting state and P2 would be part of P2S. As this is not the case, we can
say we cant have a cycle to M
11.So vsiiting N one more time does not help as no further cycles could be found as by 10. We can clip this dfs span here.

12.We reach the start node of dfs and finish the dfs.

A2. A node will turn to visited from still vsisiting
proof: Any path from node can at most include all the nodes. There are n! such formamrtions so we will end up the vsisitinmg

A3. The dfs will terminate.
Apply A2 to root node.

A4. Complexity:
Any path in a graph is a perm(partial) of atmost n nodes. we can have n! such paths so we are talking about exponential complexity but with DP
 we can sure reduce it by a bit.
