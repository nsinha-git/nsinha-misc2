1.
We can think of links like:
a a a
s s s  etc

As we start with awake state the first one is one with highest a.

We can assume we have kept B Awake and hence can keep on using highest a.

This is simply ordering of prob as per highest probability.

After that we make the reverse optimization.
2.The last step does not need to be optimized for next level so we can choose the lease a for last.

3. After 2, we can optmiz the n-1 th . We have filled till n-2th and n th is filled. We require n-1 from bottom st
(n-2)s * (cur-n-1-a - cand-a)  - (cur-n-1-s -cand-s) n(a) . If we get a positive value for this we will replace it.

If we cant we stop.

4. reduce cnt and keep on doing 2 till we reach 2nd link or stop early under break condition at 3.
