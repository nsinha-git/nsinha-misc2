1. A simple string match in a large document.
2. the algorithm is to create a precomputed states with state transitions for src string. let the target string pass
this state machine and report the offsets when final states were touched.
3.The above algorithm may not be as efficient as Knuth Pratt but we want to study the insights of this solution
all by itself.
4. We may improve this to a regex match with simple add ons like * $ ^
