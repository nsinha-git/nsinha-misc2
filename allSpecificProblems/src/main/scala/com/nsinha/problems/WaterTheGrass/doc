1. It's a variant of set-cover probelem with sprinlklers representing a subset.
2. We need to find the min of such subsets to cover the graph
3. Can we not visit any of the subsets. No, as the not visted one can be maximum per se and belong to maximal solns.
4. so o(n) atleast
5. C1. Can we pick the largest subset  and reduce to a subproblem with correct deletions of nodes.(note in general graph
picking the largest does not order the graph)
6. Let's prove the incorrectness of C1 for a general graph.
    0.Denot max subset M and best choice that global would habe chosen as Gx.
    1.If there is another good subset in the optimal path, that good subset can only remove less elements compared to our choice.
     This will lead to a sub problem that is only bigger than what our choice could have choosen,so subproblem(M) > subproblem(Gx)
    2. The remaining subsets get transformed to x' = x - M or x -Gx.
    3. Let subspace Gx has a direct next susbet N as sol so Gx + N = G
        in case we chose M, we can show N' , and Gx' still cover the remaining graph. but only N' still may not. proving that choosing max
        greedily is not optimal.

7. is C1 good enough for this graph:No never. Same argument will exactly hold. So we got to test all paths. No greedy exists.
