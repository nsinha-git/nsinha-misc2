1. The matrix consists of integers (pos and negative).
2.
++++++-+++

3. 1.Given a left top and right bottom of a matrix, generate all sub matricies for the matrix.
   2.The sub matricies are found by noting (a,b) and (c,d) and generating all pairs of (x,y) and (p,q)
    where x,p is in a,c inclusive and y,q in b,d.  After visiting every submatrices, generate two sub-matrices
     by dividing at first col, and summing  the sum of these sub matrices.
   3. Keep a DP table for each of these calculated components.
4. While doing 3 also update tag the max of all values found.

5. output the max value with the corresponding submatrice
