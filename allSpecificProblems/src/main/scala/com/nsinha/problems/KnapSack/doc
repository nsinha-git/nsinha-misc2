1. A knapsack has n elements with eight and value.There is a bag that has max weight carrying capacity. We have to maximize the value.
2. A 2^n search should find the solution.
3. Is there a good time solution
4. A dp technique can be applied using the (remaining capacity, remaining values) should be sufficient to not make us not
retraverse the same subgraph again.
5. Can there be a greedy solution. I dont think so.
