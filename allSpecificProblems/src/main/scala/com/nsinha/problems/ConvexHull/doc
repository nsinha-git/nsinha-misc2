1. Arrange the points along the x axis. Find the pivot which is one having largest x. If many, choose one. o(N)
2. Proof that a unique pivot is always on convex hull: The pivot should be in boundary of hull.
    if boundary short covers the pivot, we cant have a hull
    if over covers it, we have  a slack.
    In both cases a Delata should should be increased or reduced.
3. Proof that many unique pivots are all in the hull. These pivots are collinear in a line parallel to Y axis.
   We will choose 1 and show how the method described ends up ,choosing all the relevant points


Method when pivot is known:
0. Call ap = (p0:pivot)
1. find angles for all points from pivot. o(n)
2. for o(N) angles arrange points in increasing X.(NlogN)
3. choose points in order of highest Angle first, with highest x.
4. choose the next point; add to the front of ap
5. new ap becomes (curPoint,p-1,p-2,...)
6. check if curPoint,p-1,p-2 is an acute angle. If not, we proceed. if Yes, drop p-1 and  check further.
Aggregate analysis  based on 1 cost for adding a point and 1 cost for deleting the point bounds this to max 2n.
7. Exhaustion on points is stopping criteria.
