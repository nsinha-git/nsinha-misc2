1. A choclate with atomic pieces are laid out in rectangular grid mxn
2. K pieces {k1,k2, ...kn} needs to be satisfied by only axial cuts and one piece only
3. Note that if sum .K >  mxn: there exists  no cuts to satisfy the requirement.
4. We can store DP state(row,col, satisfiedK} as DP keys.
5. But in certain cases the 4 may be too large.
6. can we optimize 4
7. Let;s try storing just (row,satisfiedK). We need to notice that there exists a minimum col for which (row,satisfiedK) may get satisfied.
   Anything more than min col does not change the cut. So we can have implied min col as implied parameter stored in a Map.


How to implement using 7:

We will take it slow. We will implement dp state as (h,w, candidates in) and once that;s done we will normalize tables into two with 7!


phase 2:

1. Our DP is based on (Size,Candidates)
2. Can we optimize 1.
3. Given (H,Cand) , lets say for Wmin we do have a solution say with n cuts:
    can we say something about H,Cand,Wmin+r
    to get to H,Can,Wmin we need a single cut.
    so that becomes n+1.
4. One good thing is that H,Cand,Wmin+r is DAG dependent on H,Cand,Wmin so we will always have a DP entry for later before we hit former!
5. We can safely add 1 to 4 and go ahead with calculation

6. To afford that we need to store (H,Cand)-> (Wmin,Some(steps))
   At query time given H,Cand and W , if (H,Cand) does not exist we keep on finding the sol. If W < Wmin the solution will not exist. To reduce
   recompute we can have one different representation  (H,Cand)->(Whighest,None) which means that till Whighest no solution could be found.
   Wmin will always have steps != None.
