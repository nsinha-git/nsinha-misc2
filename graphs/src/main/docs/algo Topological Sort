Postulates:
    1. If n1 ↝ n2 then n1 < n2
        1. if n2 ↝ n1 also true then topology is impossible.
    2. If n1 ↮ n2   => n1 > n2 ,n2 < n1
    3. if n1 and n2 are different then either n1 > n2 or n2 > n1
    4 Topo provides a total ordering on set.
    5. Example of local ordering that is constant for a constant  implementation.


1. 1. Find the root nodes. This is doable in E
   2. do a dfs on successive root nodes. This o(E) and print the result.
   3. This is o(2E)

2. Let do better than 1.
   Do we need to find root nodes. nope
   1. Pick any node in G and do a dfs.
   2. Once finished, find uncovered sunncessive node and go to 1. else 3
   3. Done
   4. complexity: O(E + V)
