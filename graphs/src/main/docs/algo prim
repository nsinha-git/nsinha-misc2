0. ni =n1
1. Add ni to Q
2. Find all outgoing edges from ni not connecting to Q. O(n) in finding those edges. Add it to outgoing edges to OEQ .
3. Find the least of outgoing edge from OEQ. This is o(nlogE). The edge thus found gurantees to bring in a new node
4. ni = newly added node.goto 1
5. The loop runs n times. Each loop costs o(n) + n *logE = n^2logE + n^2 â‰ˆ n^2logn.
