1.a bi partite is where we have two sets of nodes nonoverallapping. such that no inner edges exist in list1 or list2, Only cross edges are
allowed from list 1 or list2.
2. Singletons can be placed in list1 or list2.
3.

4.if x1-x2-x3-x1:
l1: x1
l2: x2

but x3 can not be placed. so impossible. any odd cycle graph is non bipartite

x1-x2-x3-x4-x1
l1: x1 x3
l2: x2  x4
5.
  1. choose x1 and place in l1.place all nnbrs in l2.nbrs of last stage in l1 ...
  2. 1 is bfs(x1) where levels are placed in alternate lists.If this breaks down ,grapg is not bi partite
  3. so find all bfs max(v^3) and assign  levels to a alternating lists. For firts one choose anylist.
